# Introduction

Learning python is easy if you take it a bite at a time.
This book teaches python one tiny bite at a time.

Mastery of Python is a great goal, and I hope that this book can help you get there.
**But you don't need to master python to start benefitting from learning it!**
Take this tour, practice each little bit, and you'll find yourself writing python
long before you're done here.

So I invite you to study this book bit by bit and to use the things you learn here.
If you do that, very soon you can become competent in a very powerful language.
